# Privacy Policy for ID Detector

**Last Updated:** January 12, 2026

ID Detector ("we," "us," or "our") is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles your information.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

ID Detector operates exclusively as a local client-side tool.

- **No Data Collection:** We do not collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal data, browsing history, or usage analytics.
- **Local Processing:** All operations, including detecting HTML IDs and rendering tooltips, are performed locally within your browser using `content.js`. No data from the websites you visit is sent to external servers.

## 2. Permissions

To function correctly, the extension requires the following permission:

- **"Read and change all your data on the websites you visit" (`<all_urls>`):** This permission is strictly necessary for the extension to inject the script that detects HTML elements and displays the ID tooltip on the pages you browse. This access is used solely for the purpose of highlighting elements and displaying their IDs in real-time.

## 3. Third-Party Services

This extension does not use any third-party analytics services, tracking cookies, or advertising networks.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices. If we make any material changes, we will notify users by updating the date at the top of this policy.
